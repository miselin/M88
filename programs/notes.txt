2024-04-15: first prototype board works.

Issues that came up bringing the thing online:
- CS# signals are all floating until IO#/M is pulled low, need a pull-up! (test with 7SEG_CS#)
  - they actually aren't floating, this was a misunderstanding
- 74LS154 are wide not narrow footprints
  - buying adapters for this, but need to fix in next fab
- is the memory 128K or 64K??
  - it is 128K, but the DMUX 74LS154 is taking A16/A18/A19 into account, which limits RAM to 64K
  - quick fix is to tie pins 21, 22, 23 to GND
  - need a better way to do CS#'s for RAM & BIOS
- just use an 8-bit latch/register for the 7-seg, the 4-bit one is a pain to find


74LS154s are kinda hard to find. Look into more readily available options...
 - 74LS138s are much easier to find (Mouser has them!) - 3-to-8.
   Truly simpler logic.
