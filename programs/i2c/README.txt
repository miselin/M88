---- M88 ISA-to-I2C Utility ----

This package includes a demonstration utility for interacting with I2C devices
using the M88 ISA-to-I2C bridge. You can use the provided I2C.LIB and I2C.H
to write your own utilities, or invoke I2C.EXE directly.

The bridge card utilizes an NXP PCF8584 for which the datasheet is quite well
written for reference beyond the capabilities of this library and utility.
