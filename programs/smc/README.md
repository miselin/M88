# System Management Controller

This directory contains the source code for the System Management Controller.

This is intended to run on an ATTiny13A.

In the current design, this really only manages the ATX power signals. In future
designs, I am considering upgrading the ATTiny and introducing more capability,
such as I2C and an EEPROM that the system can interact with, perhaps for some
psuedo-ACPI power management.
