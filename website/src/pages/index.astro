    <h1>The <span class="scanlines">M88</span> Computer</h1>
    <h2>Features</h2>
    <p>
      <li>Built around the Intel 8088 CPU, running at 4.77 MHz</li>
      <li>Sockets for 640K of RAM in banks of 128K</li>
      <li>3 8-bit ISA card slots</li>
      <li>
        ATX power connector and Micro-ATX form factor - use an off-the-shelf ATX
        power supply and PC case!
      </li>
      <li>PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports</li>
      <li>An ATTiny to take care of system resets and ATX power signals</li>
      <li>Primarily designed using discrete logic in 74-series ICs</li>
    </p>
    <h2>Upcoming Features</h2>
    <p>
      The next revision of the M88 design is well and truly underway with tweaks
      based on real-world usage of the computer.
      <ul>
        <li>System clock bumped to 8 MHz</li>
        <li>
          Support for an additional (but optional) 128K of RAM at <code
            >E000:0000</code
          > for DOS upper memory blocks
        </li>
        <li>Built-in ATX fan headers</li>
        <li>
          Built-in I2C bus with <a
            href="https://learn.adafruit.com/introducing-adafruit-stemma-qt/what-is-stemma"
            target="_blank">STEMMA connectors</a
          > to easily integrate with external devices
        </li>
        <li>One more ISA card slot</li>
        <li>Logic simplifications</li>
        <li>
          Removal of the second 8259 Interrupt Controller that was serving
          limited purpose
        </li>
      </ul>

    <h2>Why?</h2>
    <p>
      The <span class="scanlines">M88</span> is a hobby project that seeks to build
      a modern computer that is compatible with the software and hardware of the
      late 1980s. I originally set out to build a computer that could support <a
        href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ/"
        target="_blank">Sid Meier's Civilization</a
      >, and achieved just that. Now, the project has expanded to explore more
      possibilities, such as experimenting with I2C bus connectivity to mix
      modern I2C devices with retro software.

    <h2>Development Log and Manual</h2>
    <p>
      You can read more about the development of the computer in this <a
        href="https://mattiselin.com/2024/05/25/building-my-own-computer/"
        target="_blank">development log</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can also read the (work-in-progress) <a href="/docs/manual.pdf"
        >manual</a
      > for the computer, which includes a reference for the hardware and software
      of the <span class="scanlines">M88</span>.
    </p>
    <h2>Additional&nbsp;<span class="scanlines">M88</span>&nbsp;Peripherals</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout the development of the <span class="scanlines">M88</span>, I've
      designed a few peripherals to help with development and testing.
